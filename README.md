# NHMS
This repository contains the DBMS course project that we had built in our 4th Sem at DAIICT. It was a group project.
The project was a group effort. The group consisted of my fellow batchmates. Now, about the project.

India's healthcare system is vast and complex, involving millions of patients, thousands of hospitals,
doctors, diseases, and insurance providers. But currently, there is no single platform that brings all
this information together in a well-organized and accessible way. This makes it hard to track patient
histories, manage insurance claims, monitor hospital resources, and analyse national health data.
Manual record-keeping or disconnected systems often lead to inefficiencies, errors, and delays in
care.
To solve this, we propose the National Healthcare Management System (NHMS), a centralized,
relational database management system. It captures the core entities of the Indian healthcare
system: patients, doctors, hospitals, diseases, insurance companies, and the government. Each entity
is modelled as a table, with relationships connecting them in meaningful ways.
The system tracks hospital affiliations, doctor specializations, prescriptions, chronic diseases, and
insurance coverage. It also includes government support for specific diseases. Through stored
procedures and powerful SQL queries, NHMS can generate bills, retrieve medical histories, track
disease trends, and evaluate insurance eligibility.
With NHMS, we aim to provide a robust and flexible foundation for better healthcare management
across the country, making data more accessible, improving coordination between institutions, and
supporting smarter healthcare decisions for all.
